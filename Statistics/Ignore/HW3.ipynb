    "## (6 points) Question 1\n",
    "Many companies have installed exercise facilities at their sites. The goal is not only to provide a bonus (free use of exercise equipment) for their employees, but also to make the employees more productive by getting them in better shape. One such (fictional) company, Informatrix Software, installed exercise equipment on site a year ago. To check whether it has had a beneficial effect on employee productivity, the company gathered data on a sample of 80 randomly chosen employees, all between the ages of 30 and 40 and all with similar job titles and duties. The company observed which of these employees use the exercise facility regularly (at least three times per week on average). This group included 23 of the 80 employees in the sample. The other 57 employees were asked whether they exercise regularly elsewhere, and 6 of them replied that they do. The remaining 51, who admitted to being nonexercisers, were then compared to the combined group of 29 exercisers.\n",
    "The comparison was based on the employees’ productivity over the year, as rated by their supervisors. Each rating was on a scale of 1 to 25, 25 being the best. To increase the validity of the study, neither the employees nor the supervisors were told that a study was in progress. In particular, the supervisors did not know which employees were involved in the study or which were exercisers. The data from the study are provided on the CSV file Question 1.\n"

One of a number of so-called Cox-2 anti-inflammatory drugs, Vioxx was considered by many people a miracle drug for alleviating the pain from arthritis and other painful afflictions. Vioxx was marketed heavily on television, prescribed by most physicians, and used by an estimated two million Americans.\n",

The study, which followed approximately 2600 subjects over a period of about 18 months, concluded that Vioxx use over a long period of time caused a significant increase in the risk of developing serious heart problems. Merck almost immediately pulled Vioxx from the American market and doctors stopped prescribing it. On the basis of the study, Merck faced not only public embarrassment but the prospect of huge financial losses.\n",

    "- Finally, look at it from Merck’s point of view. Extrapolate how many of the two million Americans are expected to develop heart problems if they take Vioxx and if they don’t take Vioxx. Based on this, answer if the results are practically significant to the company? \n",
    "- What does it stand to lose? State what type of financial losses Merck might incur. Just think of all of those American Vioxx users and what they might do. No dataset is needed for this case.

    "In the years 2000–2014, the economy took two major hits. The first was the combination of the dotcom collapse that occurred in 2000 and the attacks on the World Trade Center and on the Pentagon in 2001. These two events precipitated the stock market crash in 2001. The second hit was the subprime mortgage industry collapse that caused a financial meltdown all over the world in 2008.\n",

    "The effect on American incomes has been used as a political football by both the Democrats and the Republicans. The Democrats accused the Bush administration of causing incomes to stagnate during his administration (2001–2008). In turn, the Republicans accuse the Obama administration of the same during his administration (2009–2016). The General Social Survey allows you to determine the truth by performing inferential methods on the reported incomes (RINCOME) in the surveys. All you need to do is answer the following questions. Two datasets provided – Question 6 contains the RINCOMES and U.S. CPI Annual contains the Annual CPI values that you can use to adjust for inflation.\n"
