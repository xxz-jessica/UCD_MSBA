It\\'s not just a word, but a statement of cultural identification, of a long-standing bond of trust and respect for fellow Northern Californians, and of a [mutual understanding] between you and the rest of the world that you are from (or, in the case of anyone who has lived with kids from [NorCal], that you are an honorary resident) NorCal.
