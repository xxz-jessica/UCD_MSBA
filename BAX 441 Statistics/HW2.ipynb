    "## Question 1\n",
    "A large courier company sends invoices to customers requesting payment within 30 days. Each bill lists an address, and customers are expected to use their own envelopes to return their payments. Currently, the mean amount of time taken to pay bills are 24 days. The chief financial officer (CFO) believes that including a stamped self-addressed (SSA) envelope would decrease the amount of time. She calculates that the improved cash flow from a 2-day decrease in the payment period would pay for the costs of the envelopes and stamps. Any further decrease in the payment period would generate a profit. To test her belief, she randomly selects 220 customers and includes an SSA envelope with their invoices. The numbers of days until payment is received were recorded on the CSV file Question1. Can the CFO conclude that the plan will be profitable? Make a decision using an appropriate level of significance. Choose a significance level by performing the Type I and Type II error analysis. Also please state your null and alternative hypotheses. Write your final conclusion using the guidelines on the first page.\n"

    "## Question 2\n",
    "When an election for political office takes place, the television networks cancel regular programming and instead provide election coverage. When the ballots are counted, the results are reported. However, for important offices such as president or senator in large states, the networks actively compete to see which will be the first to predict a winner. This is done through exit polls , wherein a random sample of voters who exit the polling booth is asked for whom they voted. From the data, the sample proportion of voters supporting the candidates is computed. A statistical technique is applied to determine whether there is enough evidence to infer that the leading candidate will garner enough votes to win. Suppose that in the exit poll from the state of Florida during the 2000 year elections, the pollsters recorded only the votes of the two candidates who had any chance of winning, Democrat Albert Gore (code = 1) and Republican George W. Bush (code = 2) . The polls close at 8:00 p.m. Can the networks conclude from these data that the Republican candidate will win the state? Should the network announce at 8:01 p.m. that the Republican candidate will win? Make a decision using an appropriate level of significance. Choose a significance level by performing the Type I and Type II error analysis. Also please state your null and alternative hypotheses. Write your final conclusion using the guidelines on the first page.\n"
